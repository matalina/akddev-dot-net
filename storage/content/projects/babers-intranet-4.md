## Project Brief

This project was the bulk of what I managed for the timeI was with Baber's Inc.  It grew as business needs changed, and peices came and went as needed. The purpose of the intranet was a place to store all relavent reports, and modules that helped stores and locations preform their duties with efficiency.

This project has undergone three major revisions.

The first version I wrote was based on CodeIngitor 2.  Below is a list of modules created.

- Key Metric reports
- Inventory Ordering System
- Credit Card Reconciliation/Expense reports
- Commissions/Bonus System
- Field Receipt Book management system
- RAL check printing (Early refund checks/loans for Taxes)
- Project management system for Construction Crew
- Module for an Exchange Lease program to augment the third party POS
- Various Marketing Campaing manager for babers.com website
- Many reports

Version 2 of the Intranet was created in Laravel 4 and has since been upgraded and is currently running 7.0 at time of writing this.
